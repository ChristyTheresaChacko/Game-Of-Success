Project Description :

Our project, Game of Success is an engaging thought provoking game designed to inspire players to see life from a new perspective. Through its three main parts, the game mirrors life's journey by presenting challenges, surprises and oppertunities to learn and grow. It mainly focuses on helping players realize that success is persevering and embracing journey, no matter what lies ahead . In short it presents complex insights about life through a useless fun game.

The Problem:

The non-existent problem is nobody would ever say "Life's a thrilling adventure: learn, apply, and unlock endless surprises!" in such an engaging and fun way but we learn it through our life. 

The Solution: 
We’ve designed an engaging game that explores the insights of life through play as the useless project solution for the problem . 

You start in a colorful world of bubbles, each representing a piece of knowledge. Player can pop two bubbles which represents, instead of trying to absorb everything at once, you focus on just one or two skills at a time, which is very much needed in our life too.

As you pop each bubble, you collect two numbers to remember. In the next round, you’ll rearrange those numbers, symbolizing how we must organize and apply knowledge at the right moment.

The adventure culminates in a surprise shooter game, where you face challenges using what you’ve learned. This round reinforces that life is about learning, applying knowledge, and unlocking new experiences.

In short, this game teaches that life is an adventurous journey where learning and timely application lead to greater rewards. Get ready for the adventure ahead!.
