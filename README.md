Project Description :

Our project, Game of Success is an engaging thought provoking game designed to inspire players to see life from a new perspective.Through its three main parts, the game mirrors life's journey by presenting challenges, surprises and oppertunities to learn and grow. It mainly focuses on helping players realize that success is persevering and embracing journey, no matter what lies ahead . In short it presents complex insights about life through a useless fun game.

The Problem:

Nobody would ever say "Life's a thrilling adventure: learn, apply, and unlock endless surprises!" in such an engaging and fun way.

The Solution: 

We presented a fun game to realize the insight of life .
Starting from a game with random motion of bubbles represent the knowledge facts around us. Instead of getting into acquriring whole knowledge we must acquire 1 or 2 skills at a time. Each bubble represents a fact and bubbles present you two numbers which must be kept in mind .
The second part contains a game with the numbers yoy collected in first round from the facts.
